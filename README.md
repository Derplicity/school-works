# School Works

A compilation of many of the programming assignments I completed during my degree.

## Breakdown

#### Algorithms & Algorithm Analysis

> Design, analysis, and evaluation of efficient algorithms for a wide variety of computing problems.

- `SumsToN.java`: Produces a list of all the different ways to get a collection of positive integers adding up to _n_.

#### Computer & Network Security

> How computers and networks are compromised and how to secure them.

- `cryptography-project`: _Keys_ are generated and used for a _Sender_ to encrypt a message and a _Receiver_ to decrypt that same message. Encryption is done via SHA256, RSA and AES.

- `rbac`: Parses, creates and prints the access control rights defined, as well as allows a user to query said rights.

- `ssl-connection`: Creates a _Client_ and _Server_ which are able to communicate over an SSL Connection.

- `tea-cryptography`: Encrypts and Decrypts a message via [TEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Encryption_Algorithm).

#### Introduction to Theory of Computation

#### Machine Learning

#### Operating Systems

#### Principles of Programming Languages

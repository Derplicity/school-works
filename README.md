# School Works

A compilation of many of the programming assignments I completed during my degree.

## Breakdown

#### Algorithms & Algorithm Analysis

> Design, analysis, and evaluation of efficient algorithms for a wide variety of computing problems.

- `SumsToN.java`: Produces a list of all the different ways to get a collection of positive integers adding up to _n_.

#### Computer & Network Security

> Understanding how computers and networks are compromised and how to secure them.

- `cryptography-project`: _Keys_ are generated and used for a _Sender_ to encrypt a message and a _Receiver_ to decrypt that same message. Encryption is done via SHA256, RSA and AES.

- `rbac`: Parses, creates and prints the access control rights defined, as well as allows a user to query said rights.

- `ssl-connection`: Creates a _Client_ and _Server_ which are able to communicate over an SSL Connection.

- `tea-cryptography`: Encrypts and Decrypts a message via [TEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Encryption_Algorithm).

#### Introduction to Theory of Computation

> The exploration of language theory and computability.

- `TableDrivenFSA`: Processes a transition table to determine [FSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) acceptance.

- `language-util`: A class which represents a finite language.

#### Machine Learning

> Introduction to a variety of machine learning techniques and their application to data.

- `contour-plot.py`: Creates a contour figure via [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

- `linear-regression_gradient-descent.py`: Creates predictions of a model via linear regression using gradient-descent.

- `linear-regression_polynomial-regression.py`: Creates and compares the predictions of a model via both linear regression and polynomial regression.

#### Operating Systems

> The use, design, development, and implementation of modern computer operating systems.

- `sudoku-solution-validator`: Determines whether the input [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) puzzle is valid or invalid.

#### Principles of Programming Languages

> The analysis of the evolution of programming languages and their implementations.

- `bottom-up-parser`: Implements a parser using a [bottom-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom-up_parsing) approach.

- `lexical-analyzer`: Translates symbols in a file into lexeme units.

- `palindrome-search`: Determines how many palindromic sequences exist, where the palindrome must contain some number _m_ and where all numbers must add up to _n_.

- `syntax-analyzer`: Uses the lexeme units generated from the lexical analyzer to determine whether a given file has valid syntax according to the defined grammar.
